# bigint
Bigint project

The purpose of this project is to develop an Abstract Data Type using classes in C++.
Data type 'int' in c++ has a limited word size, however when working with larger integer values, larger sizes may be neccessary.
Bigint develops an ADT that takes any size positive integer by using array implementation.

Running the program:
- command "make tests" runs all tests
- command "make add" builds and runs add.cpp. This program reads in two numbers, writes them out, adds them together, and prints the result. This process continues until the end of the given input file.
- command "make multiply" builds and runs multiply.cpp, which works similarly to add.cpp, multiplying two numbers rather than adding them.
